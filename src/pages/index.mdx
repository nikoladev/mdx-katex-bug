import {
  KatexBlock,
  KatexInline,
} from '../components/Katex.jsx'

"Simple" Katex works:

$$
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

Also inline $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ as you can see.

---

"Complex" Katex does not work:


$$
\begin{aligned}
  \bar{x} &= \dfrac{0+1+2+ \ldots +8}{9} = 3.56 \\
  \bar{y} &= \dfrac{23.5+25+ \ldots +37.5}{9}=30
\end{aligned}
$$


Another example that doesn't work:


$x < 3$

This is a workaround for the complex Katex:

<KatexBlock
  formula={`
    \\begin{aligned}
      \\bar{x} &= \\dfrac{0+1+2+ \\ldots +8}{9} = 3.56 \\\\
      \\bar{y} &= \\dfrac{23.5+25+ \\ldots +37.5}{9}=30
    \\end{aligned}
  `}
/>

(It also requires a slightly different input: every backslash needs to be duplicated)

<KatexInline
  formula='x < 3'
/>
